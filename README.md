Its mission is to provide a scalable, ethical, and reliable Emotional AI through the [**InferenceOps**]() paradigm, ensuring operational efficiency and real-time governance.

<br><br>


## 2. [Context of Digital Transformation, Corporate Compliance, and SAP GTS E4HANA]()

<br>

The migration to SAP Global Trade Services (GTS) E4HANA represents a strategic challenge for several global organizations that need to update legacy systems (SAP GTS ECC/11) due to the end of support in 2025. This transition is not merely technical but involves a complex operational and regulatory transformation.

Traditional international trade and compliance processes face risks of discontinuity, increased costs, and a shortage of specialists during this migration. The scarcity of qualified professionals and the need for seamless integration with modern systems place significant pressure on IT and compliance teams.

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| [**Description**]()        | The process of teaching the model with lots of data, adjusting its parameters | The process where the already trained model uses what it learned to analyze new data and make predictions |
| [**Resource usage**]()     | Very high: requires many hours/days on powerful GPUs to process data and adjust weights | Lower, but continuous: each prediction uses fewer resources, but occurs many times per day/month |
| [**Practical example**]()  | Training a voice recognition model with thousands of hours of audio, running for many days on high-performance servers | Using the trained model to convert a user's voice to text in real time on a mobile phone |
| [**Cost comparison**]()    | Training can cost thousands of dollars in cloud computing for a large model | Inference may cost cents per thousand predictions, but the cost adds up with many users |
| [**Frequency**]()          | Once or rarely (when the model needs updating) | Continuous, every time the system uses AI for a prediction or decision |
| [**Typical duration**]()   | Days to weeks, depending on model and data    | Milliseconds to seconds per prediction      |
| [**Impact of scale**]()    | Greater scale means more data and more processing time to train | Greater scale means more predictions made, increasing inference costs proportionally |

<br>

### [Conclusion]()

- [**Training**]() is a heavy and more expensive step, but is performed sporadically.
- [**Inference**]() is a lighter, but constant step, occurring every time the system uses AI for real-time decisions.
- It is common for the cumulative inference cost over time to be significant, especially for services with many users.

# 5. [Ethical Dimension]()

Guarantees of transparency, accountability, end-to-end privacy, compliance with GDPR, LGPD, and AI Act, and sustainability. The ethical dimension is a fundamental pillar for MindfulAI, reflecting a strong commitment to transparency, accountability, and international regulatory alignment.

We especially emphasize strict compliance with the European Union AI Act (EU AI Act), a critical regulatory milestone for artificial intelligence technologies using emotional recognition systems based on biometric data.

<br>

## 5.1 [Regulation and Definition under EU AI Act]()

<br>

The EU AI Act represents a significant advance in AI regulation, especially regarding emotion recognition systems. According to Article 3(39) of the AI Act, an "emotion recognition system" is a technology that identifies or infers emotions or intentions of natural persons based on biometric data — physical, physiological, or behavioral, such as facial images or voice patterns.

Recital 18 clarifies that these systems cover emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, but exclude simple physical states like fatigue, except in safety cases (e.g., preventing driver accidents).

<br>

## 5.2 [Prohibitions and High-Risk Classification]()

<br>

- Prohibition in workplace and educational environments: According to Article 5(1)(f), the use of these systems in these locations is prohibited, except for medical or safety purposes, due to the high possibility of biased, discriminatory results and the complexity of emotional signals across cultures and individuals.
- Classified as high-risk system: Annex III classifies these systems as “high risk,” subjecting them to strict regulatory requirements because of the potential for discrimination and impact on fundamental rights.

<br>

## 5.3 [Transparency and Data Protection]()

<br>

- Article 50(3) of the AI Act requires users to know when their biometric data is processed for emotional inference, ensuring accessible transparency even for vulnerable groups, per Recital 132.
- The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complements this framework, imposing strict rules on the processing of biometric data, which is sensitive data. Compliance with GDPR is mandatory, ensuring protection of individuals' rights and freedoms.

<br>

## 5.4 [Balance between Innovation and Regulation]()

<br>

The AI Act seeks to balance technological innovation with protection of fundamental rights, imposing measures to mitigate risks of misuse and discrimination. High-risk classification does not mean automatic permission, as use must comply with existing laws and principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

<br>

## 5.5 [Important Dates]()

<br>

[-]() July 12, 2024: Official publication of the AI Act.

[-]() August 1, 2024: Entry into force of the AI Act.

[-]() February 2, 2025: Prohibition of the use of emotional recognition systems in workplaces and schools.

[-]() August 2, 2026: Specific rules for high-risk systems come into force.

<br>

## 5.6 [Enforcement and Penalties]()

<br>

[-]() Non-compliance may result in administrative fines of up to €35 million or 7% of the company's global turnover, whichever is higher.

[-]() Specific penalties for providers, distributors, importers, among others, may reach €15 million or 3% of annual turnover.

[-]() False or incomplete information may result in fines of up to €7.5 million or 1% of turnover.

# 19- [Financial Plan – Mindful Emotion AI]()

This plan consolidates and corrects inconsistencies, providing transparent projections, operational breakdowns, break-even, and cash flow for sustainable management.

<br>

## 19.1- [What is SaaS? Explanation and Source of Values]()

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a software delivery model where applications are hosted by a service provider and accessed by users over the internet, typically via a subscription model rather than one-time purchase and installation.

In SaaS, the service provider manages the infrastructure, security, updates, and maintenance centrally, allowing clients to use the software on demand. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and predictable costs.

The values used in this plan are based on market research and industry benchmarks for SaaS startups, including:

- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) derived from SaaS industry reports.
- Customer growth projections consistent with typical SaaS adoption curves.
- Cost structure percentages reflecting cloud infrastructure, technical teams, marketing, and administrative components common in tech startups.
- Financial benchmarks from sources like Finrofca, GetSmartCue, and Chargebee, cited below.

This ensures the financial model is grounded in realistic assumptions aligned with the SaaS business model.

<br>

## 19.2- [Financial Projections]()

Growth is based on a [SaaS](https://github.com/Mindful-AI-Assistants/Project-Startup-Mindful-Emotional-AI-Scalable-Ethical-InferenceOps/blob/c68c7ffcb9fbd5615973d14cc6543a5dec45a9a4/SaaS_Software_as_a_Service.md) - Software as Service subscription model plus custom AI services.

- [**Active users forecast:**]() Begin with 1,000, scaling to 10,000 in 12 months.
- [**Initial ARPU - Average Revenue Per User :**]() R$ 80.00/month.
- [**Additional income:**]() Consulting/integration projects.
