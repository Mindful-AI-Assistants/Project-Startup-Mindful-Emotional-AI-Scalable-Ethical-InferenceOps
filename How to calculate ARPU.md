# ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) / Receita Média por Usuário

## English

**ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** is a key financial metric that measures the average revenue generated per user or customer over a specific period, typically monthly or annually. It is widely used in technology, telecommunications, streaming services, mobile apps, and digital platforms.

<br>

### Formula

<br><br>

$$
ARPU = \frac{Total\ Revenue\ in\ the\ Period}{Number\ of\ Active\ Users\ in\ the\ Period}
$$

<br><br>

### Example

Imagine a streaming service that generates $100,000 in revenue in a month and has 2,000 active users:

<br><br>

$$
ARPU = \frac{100,000}{2,000} = 50
$$

<br><br>

This means that, on average, each user contributes $50 in revenue during that month.

<br>

### Importance

* Assess the financial performance of a product or service  
* Compare revenue contributions across different user segments  
* Make informed strategic decisions regarding pricing, promotions, and growth
